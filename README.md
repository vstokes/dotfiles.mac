# dotfiles.mac
The incomplete adventure of my dotfiles.  This adventure started unexpectedly, but I will create something that all people can use.  This will allow mac to graze free in the world of the interwebz, and allow me time to work the important things in life...RC cars.

I am taking this adventure with eieio.xyz through his fantastic udemy course.
