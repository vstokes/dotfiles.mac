# dotfiles.mac
The incomplete adventure of my dotfiles.  This adventure started unexpectedly, but I will create something that all people can use.  This will allow mac to graze free in the world of the interwebz, and allow me time to work the important things in life...RC cars.

I am taking this adventure with eieio.xyz through his fantastic udemy course.

## Apps
Phase 1
1. zsh
  - ohmyzsh
    - Run the following command to install:
	- `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
    - I am currently using the `half-life` as my ZSH_THEME.
    - I will be adding things to this as time goes on, but currently I need to get it setup to where it makes sense for other people.
  - ohmyzsh extensions
    - This will house information about which extensions I am using.
2. vim
  - vimrc
  - add-ons
3. git
  - gitconfig
4. brew
  - general brew config
